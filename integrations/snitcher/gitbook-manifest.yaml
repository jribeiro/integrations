    # Overview

    Snitcher empowers B2B teams to understand, engage, and convert anonymous website visitors into potential leads using cutting-edge identification technology, real-time visitor tracking, and data-driven audience insights.

    # How it works

    The integration injects the Snitcher script on your page, using the configured Snitcher ID, so that you can understand which companies are visiting your GitBook site

    # Configure

    GitBook admins can enable the Snitcher integration by navigating to organization settings.  The integration can be enabled on single or multiple spaces available publicly.
